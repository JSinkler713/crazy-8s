### User experience
#### Starting the game
The user will open up a page that has a deck showing and a button in the to right hand of the page. To start the game the user will click the button and be dealt a hand of seven cards. The computer will also be dealt a hand. The players hand will appear on the bootom of the screen face-up so that they can see which cards they have.
#### Playing
The deck will flip over a card in the "Played Cards" space on the screen. The player will then be prompted to click a card in order to play it on the pile. The player may only play a card if it matches one of the following.
* the card has the same suit as the card showing
* the card has the same number such as a `4 of clubs = 4 of spades`
* the card the player wants to play is an eight
#### If they can't play a card
the user will have to draw from the deck by clicking on the top of the deck until they have a card they can play. Likewise the computer will have to draw until they get a useable card.
#### The game ends when the player or computer runs out of cards.
